# How to use it?

You can select a city from the list, or select by your location. The button will notify you if you have disabled the use of your location or not.

The application has a carousel with working buttons, either side ones or dots, or you can just swipe. If you need to view a particular day, you can select it and its information will be displayed in detail on the top panel.

# Can I use the application on my device?

Yes. The application is fully adaptive.
